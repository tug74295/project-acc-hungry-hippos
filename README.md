Section #, as well as any words that quickly give your peers insights into the application like programming language, development platform, type of application, etc.

## Project Abstract

This project proposes the development of a web-based application that digitally recreates the classic Hungry Hungry Hippos game. The application will be publicly accessible, allowing users to interact with the game through a web browser. A key feature of this version is its compatibility with Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, ensuring accessibility for users with speech or motor impairments. Players will control their hippos using input from an AAC device, promoting gameplay that is inclusive of all people. The project emphasizes accessible design, real-time interactivity, and an engaging, competitive experience.

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
