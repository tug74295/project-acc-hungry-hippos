        * Indicator shows the selected food

## Game.ts

### Method: `setFoodKeys(keys: string[])`

* **Purpose:** Defines which food keys are allowed to be spawned.
* **Test Case:**
    - **Input:** `['apple', 'pizza']`
    - **Expected Result:** `foodKeys` field is updated with these values.

---

### Method: `addFoodManually(foodKey: string)`

* **Purpose:** Manually adds a food item to the game (e.g. from AAC).
* **Test Case:**
    - **Input:** `'apple'`
    - **Mocked:** `foods.create`, `setScale`, `setVelocityY`, `setBounce`, `setCollideWorldBounds`
    - **Expected Result:**
        - `foods.create()` called with a lane `x` and `'apple'`
        - All config methods called with correct values

---

### Method: `spawnFood()`

* **Purpose:** Automatically spawns food from a random key and lane.
* **Test Case:**
    - **Precondition:** `foodKeys = ['apple']`
    - **Mocked:** `Phaser.Utils.Array.GetRandom`, `foods.create`
    - **Expected Result:** `foods.create()` called with valid food key and lane

---

### Method: `handleFoodCollision(hippoObj, foodObj)`

* **Purpose:** Removes food when it overlaps with the hippo.
* **Test Case:**
    - **Input:** a food object with `.destroy()` mocked
    - **Expected Result:** `destroy()` called on food

---

### Method: `update()`

* **Purpose:** Removes any food object that touches the ground.
* **Test Case:**
    - **Input:** a group of food objects, some with `body.blocked.down = true`
    - **Expected Result:** Only those with `blocked.down = true` are destroyed

# Hippo Class (game Character)

- **Test Case 1: Initialization State**
  -Initialization with Scene and Physics: 
    - Input: scene, x, y, texture, moveStrategy
    - Procedure:
      - 1. Create a mock Phaser.scene and a mock MoveStrategy
      - 2. Instantiate a Hippo object
      - 3. Call isMouthOpen()
    - Expected Output: true

- **Test Case 2: Toggle Mouth State**
  - Objective: Verify that toggleMouth() flips the mouth state and updates the frame 
  - Input: N/A
  - Procedure:
    - 1. Call toggleMouth() once 
    - 2. Check isMouthOpen() -> should be false
    - 3. Call toggleMouth() again
    - 4. Check isMouthOpen() -> should be true
  - Expected Output: Mouth state alternates with each call 

- **Test Case 3: Movement Delegation**
  - Objective: Confirm update() delegates to the assigned move strategy
  -Input: Phaser.Types.Input.Keyboard.Cursorkeys object (mocked)
  -Procedure:
    - 1. Spy on the update() method of the mock strategy 
    - 2. Call hippo.update(mockCursorKeys)
  - Expected Output: moveStrategy.update() is called with hippo and mockCursorKeys

- **Test Case 4: Change Strategy at Runtime**
  - Objective: Ensure setStrategy() properly replaces the movement strategy
  - Input: New MoveStrategy instance
  - Procedure: 
    - 1. Create a second mock MoveStrategy 
    - 2. Set the new Strategy using setStrategy()
    - 3. Call update() with a mock cursor input 
  -Expected Output: The new strategy's update() method is called and not the old one
